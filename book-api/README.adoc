# Book store application

This is a simple book store.
It publishes a couple of endpoints through a RESTful API.
It's rather simple as it only has some basic crud operations.

It requires an external service to generate an ISBN for each book to store.
To simulate that part, we created a number-api project to generate some random numbers (see NumberResource).

# How to test it?

With TomEE, it's possible to generate a fat and self container jar with the server and the application inside.

`mvn clean install -o`

On the `target/` directory, there is a `book-api-exec.jar` file.
It is 41MB which is seems quite big for a single class.
Indeed it contains also the TomEE application server in it.
With that in mind, we can now say, it's pretty small ;-)

Now, from a terminal, execute `java -jar target/book-api-exec.jar`.
The server should start and deploy my application

# Call it

Using a plain CURL command, it's possible to test our application running.

TODO

# Create a docker image for it

`mvn clean install docker:build -o`

Should package 2 docker images.

`mvn docker:push` to push to your local registry.

Check it out with `https://localhost:5000/v2/_catalog`
